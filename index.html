            <div id="instruction" class="rc-CML styled show-soft-breaks" dir="auto"><div><p>Create a narrative visualization implemented as an interactive web page, using your knowledge of visual communication and narrative structure, along with your skills at D3 programming in JavaScript. The narrative visualization should be implemented on a publicly visible website, such as github.io. See <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://pages.github.com/</a>  for instructions on how to use github to host a website. You will turn in this project by submitting the URL to the narrative visualization for grading, along with an essay describing how the interactive web page contains the elements of a narrative visualization and satisfies the requirements of this assignment.</p><p>The narrative visualization should follow one of the three effective narrative visualization structures:</p><ul><li>a martini glass, where the message is delivered without allowing user exploration until the end,</li><li>an interactive slideshow, where user exploration is allowed at some or all of the steps of the story, or</li><li>a drill down story. which presents an overview and allows the user to explore different storylines from there.</li></ul><p>You <strong>must</strong> use the D3 library to construct your pages. You cannot use Tableau Stories, Vega, Vega-Lite, Ellipses or any other high-level tool designed for data visualization to implement your narrative visualization.</p><p>The narrative visualization should be built with scenes, annotations, parameters, and triggers.</p><ul><li>The scenes should follow a template for visual consistency and follow an order to best convey the message. One way to implement different scenes is to make each a separate web page. Another way is to use <strong>d3.select(id).html = ""</strong> to clear the contents of a container element (e.g. an SVG element) and then repopulate that element using <strong>.append()</strong>.</li><li>The annotations should follow a template for visual consistency from scene to scene. These annotations should also highlight and reinforce specific data items or trends that make the important points for the desired messaging of the narrative visualization. The lessons on d3 popups can be helpful on how to to make and place annotations, but as an annotation, they should appear as part of the scene and not have to wait for a mouseover event.</li><li>The parameters are the state variables of your narrative visualization. Your narrative visualization should use these parameters to control the construction of scenes. These parameters will be key variables in your JavaScript code, as well as parameters to key functions used to set up each scene.</li><li>The triggers connect user interface actions to changes in parameters that change the state of the narrative visualization. These triggers can be event listeners (callback functions) that change parameter values and then update the display to reflect the result of the event.</li></ul><p>This assignment can be successfully completed using as few as three scenes. Those three scenes can simply highlight different details or different data from the same chart. That chart can also be one of the charts we have previously used as an example (e.g. the scatterplot of 2017 automobile data). You can use any dataset you would like, or one of the datasets we have used previously. Free-form user interaction can be as simple as tooltip popups that allow the user to see more information on data items. Just be sure to indicate when a user can access these tooltips, and make sure this free-form user interaction fits properly into the narrative visualization structure.</p><p><strong>Due to the end of the semester, this assignment has a hard deadline of 11:59pm CDT Sunday, Aug. 2nd, 2020.</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="rc-InstructionsSlideOut__review-criteria-section"><h3 class="_3upg67c">Review Criteria</h3><div class="rc-InstructionsSlideOut__review-criteria-content"><div id="" class="rc-CML styled show-soft-breaks" dir="auto"><div><p>An essay will be required and will be submitted along with the URL of the narrative visualization.

        <h2>Report/Essay</h2>
        <p>To avoid repetition and redundant explanation in some sections I have briefly referenced or kept to minimal explanation if the point of view or topic is covered in other section. This happened as there were quite a few areas of discussion which lapped over each other.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Sections</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>Messaging: What is the message you are trying to communicate with the narrative visualization?</h4>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS',monospace; text-align: justify"><i>The message I am communicating here is how severe the impact of covid-19 has been in terms of death rate in a given stipulated duration. The comparison is however in two different chosen time period but that’s not idea to compare within same slice of time period but to understand the comparable aspect of the data in terms of death severity.
            I have, first, painted the picture of overall covid cases and its resultant death numbers and then painted the view of relationship between the cases and death. And then it’s been compared to the death numbers of other high death rate/number diseases for just one year (2005).
            When one visually sees the overall outcome after a given period, one can note that there were few other diseases/causes of death which yield pretty much similar death rate/numbers. Do we pay equal attention to other death causes and be equally proactive to curb the death rate or was the covid-19 hyped owing to the large devastating effect it has left on world economy and the way we lived?
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <h4>Narrative Structure: Which structure was your narrative visualization designed to follow (martini glass, interactive slide show or drop-down story)? How does your narrative visualization follow that structure? (All of these structures can include the opportunity to "drill-down" and explore. The difference is where that opportunity happens in the structure.)</h4>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS',monospace; text-align: justify"><i>The scenes are built on martini glass concept for narrative structure. This structure built here follows the tight pattern of telling a tale with given flexibility to user to hover and check different data presented, which is later at the end followed by a scene which enables user to do free exploration of the death rate/numbers caused due to other reasons and its impact, driving a visual impact in terms of measurable and comparable numbers.
            There is a specific chronology of data which I have presented in the martini glass style, taking the user from covid cases to death, to the relation between the two, to demonstrate using bar charts based on positions of bars to give sense of quantification of nominal/categorical items.
            The last scene is solid conclusion plus a way of further examination by the user.
        </i></p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h4>Visual Structure: What visual structure is used for each scene? How does it ensure the viewer can understand the data and navigate the scene? How does it highlight to urge the viewer to focus on the important parts of the data in each scene? How does it help the viewer transition to other scenes, to understand how the data connects to the data in other scenes?</h4>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS',monospace; text-align: justify"><i>The visual structure of each scene has been picked for a reason. The covid cases and deaths were a continuous series of events so I have used the line chart along with tooltip on each axes points.
            The visual structure begins with the introduction to my thought process and kicking off the tale. I have used 2 navigation points in the scenes to enable user to go back and forth (left and right arrow). I understand providing more navigation may confuse some users, but from my perspective it provides the opportunity to go back as well in case there is some conclusion or cross relation between the scene that needs to be re-visited for later realization. Also, I have added the carousel slider to jump from any scene to any scene.
            The visual structure pretty much in every scene contains a title and clear chosen axis categories with highlighted horizontal position system. Where it was not possible to have the x-axis data points mentioned I have tilted them at an angle for better view. All the axes have names to represent them, with tooltip (to hover is mentioned in the write-up on each scene) in every scene and unit of data very clearly can be comprehended as well.
            And most importantly I have used a section of write up to support my visualization and tell my side of perspective, it helps set the scene from creator’s point of view.
            The color consistency also was kept in mind while designing.
        </i></p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h4>Scenes: What are the scenes of your narrative visualization? How are the scenes ordered, and why</h4>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS',monospace; text-align: justify"><i>You can refer to the scene built up in the “Appendix” section of this document or if you reading this on the webpage, you can follow each scene and it’s built up on each navigation point.
            To address the scene order and why? – To answer a high-level question of “how impactful and severe covid-19 has been?”, it is essential to draw user’s attention on first opening scene to understand the number of cases and how they have progressed in a time frame. Then it is necessary to create a picture of repercussions of growing cases by showing the death numbers as line plot.
            To understand the relationship between number of cases to the death, becomes essential need for each state within USA. From here straight to the comparison portion of the visualization which depicts user to understand the death rate/number compared to other leading causes (Note- Not of same time period) where data for other reasons were for 1 full year compared to the data for covid-19 from 1.5 years. Here in this scene user can hover to give sense of quantification from positioning of the bar height and along with the positive or negative difference of corresponding bar data with visual dotted horizontal line cutting across and pointing to scale on y-axis. This data in this particular scene is cumulative of all the states.
            The last scene is built based on previous scene but giving additional flexibility to the user to explore data for various states within the USA.
        </i></p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h4>Annotations: What template was followed for the annotations, and why that template? How are the annotations used to support the messaging? Do the annotations change within a single scene, and if so, how and why</h4>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS',monospace; text-align: justify"><i>I have used the present annotation style from d3 annotation library, annotation callout circle to be specific which has angular style of pointing to the data point and gives a way to provide title and description to paint the context. The angular way of pointing the data gives cleaner non-overlapping style of communication.
            This call out annotation is static in nature and remains on the opening of this particular screen but is only attached to the ‘svg’ of this screen alone and does not appear on any other screen.
            Now circling back to the original question “how impactful and severe covid-19 has been?”, this annotation helps draw a conclusion “from my point of view” that other “leading” death data being for 1 year time frame is still very much comparable and in range to other top leading causes’ death numbers and still lesser compared to deaths by “heart disease”.
            From my perspective there is also a dynamic annotation referred to as tooltip in first 3 scenes which speaks about the data associated to the coordinate on which user hovers and shows only on action of hovering and then transitions to fade away in 3rd scene.
        </i></p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h4>Parameters: What are the parameters of the narrative visualization? What are the states of the narrative visualization? How are the parameters used to define the state and each scene?</h4>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS',monospace; text-align: justify"><i>Parameter of scenes are different for few of scenes. For scene 1 and 2, the horizontal axis parameter is date or time related which is a series values and vertical axis is numbers which are quantifiable. The 3rd scene parameter is also “visible and direct” as first 2 scenes, but here its number of deaths and number of cases which are again quantifiable on horizontal and vertical axis respectively. These are static or fixed parameters.
            Other pieces of parameters implemented in these 3 scenes are tooltip which change the visualization by adding a component of information to scene and the goes away when un-hovered.
            The 4th scene is categorical on horizontal axis and quantitative on vertical axis. Here there is a hovering parameter which adds the comparison values positive or negative to the existing scene to compare the magnitude of the bars for different category of data and goes away when mouse pointer moves away.
            Another parameter that could be counted here is the navigation component that is “arrow”, which helps transition between scenes. And similar function is applied on the carousel slider.
            5th slide is having a dropdown parameter which dynamically changes the state of the visualization by selecting data for different states. Here the state of parameter are the dropdown values which are state within USA.
        </i></p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h4>Triggers: What are the triggers that connect user actions to changes of state in the narrative visualization? What affordances are provided to the user to communicate to them what options are available to them in the narrative visualization?</h4>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS',monospace; text-align: justify"><i>Tooltip as explained above in first 3 scenes appear when hover is done on a data point and disappears when mouse is moved away. This parameter of mouse event is the trigger which connects the user action to change in the state of the scene user is on.
            The 4th scene as explained above also has user action-based parameter of mouse action/movement which ties the result to display of the horizontal broken yellow line to demonstrate the magnitude of the y-scale and also shows the positive/negative differences between the bars of the categorical values of the x-axis.
            And the last scene which is the 5th scene has a dropdown with states values within USA. There is paragraph which points the user to try the dropdown. Otherwise, dropdown is visual enough for common user to try and trigger the change in the bar height based on the data points chosen for different states (also by default “Alabama” appears in the drop-down value)
            Note if we considering the 1st screen of written paragraphs then all the reference of scenes mentioned above will shift by 1. I did not consider the 1st paragraph slide of visualization as a ‘scene’.
        </i></p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h4>Update to the data, scripts, data on each scene, also source of data and transformations?</h4>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS',monospace; text-align: justify"><i>The reference to the data and the inspiration or other resources used are mentioned in the ‘Notes’ tab of the webpage.
            I have used 2 different methods to group the datapoint by date for covid data and by state which you can find in the GitHub link as ‘data_cleaing.py’
            ‘covid-us-states-group-date.csv’ is used by scene 1 and 2 which is direct product of method ‘group_by_date_us_covid()’

            Scene 3 uses ‘covid-us-states-group-state.csv’ which is direct output of ‘group_by_state_us_covid()’

            4th scene uses direct hardcoded data points on the bar.js script in function ‘barinit’ the reference can be found in the overall_death.csv which was calculated manually using excel techniques.

            5th scene uses ‘other_death.csv’ which is manually calculated sheet generated from original data cause of other death data from website (mentioned in Notes tab) and covid-19 data (data source mentioned in the Notes tab) and this is for each state.

                                I could pick nothing other than the hot on-going world of Covid. There are tons of conspiracy theories,
                                I love learning briefly about different views of people, but I have my own perspective and its likely based on data.<br><br>
                                There was one question of many that was bothering me a lot.
                                Was the impact of Covid on death rate really substantially high? Now this can be interpreted in many
                                different ways. I just wanted to see where we stand right now in terms of the number of deaths in USA.<br><br>
                                I started looking for data on death caused by other diseases but not much luck but then tripped on 2005 data per state
                                within USA on death related to leading causes. Voila! Even though it’s kind of remote comparison as situations and
                                things are different now, but it’s not too long ago, is it? So I went ahead!.<br>
                                <br>Now, one can argue about how old a disease is, the prevention technologies, and what not, but that's a story of another day!<br><br>

                            In previous and current slide you can notice the increasing pattern of the cases and death.
                            So in many cases this can be taken as death directly proportional to cases in many cases.

                            What you looking at here is a scatterplot of deaths vs cases in numbers put together for all the
                            states within USA. When you hover over, you can see which state had how many cases and deaths overall.
                            This data on current slide is cumulative of date. You can say there is a pattern of direct proportionality
                            as I was indicating earlier.

                            Here I have created a simple bar chart to put things in perspective in descending order of magnitude
                            of death occurrences overall in all states for Covid-19 in the span mentioned earlier with deaths due
                            to other causes from 2005 data of all states in USA. I have also implemented a line which appears
                            to help visually in giving idea of magnitude (y-axis) against the ordinal death causes. Also,
                            to help, when hover this should show a difference of numbers +/- compared to the bar/s next to it.

                            <b>To my original question on the Covid-19 impact, it’s very much comparable to heart disease and cancer and
                            not to forget, the covid death data is for 1.5 years and yes, its communicable disease unlike heart disease
                            and cancer. I will leave it up to you to have your conclusion, but I have mine &#128540;

                            I have created this additional slide so you can explore further per state in terms of magnitude
                            of deaths for these diseases, alongside of Covid-19. And again, this is per state within USA and
                            timeline for these data is same as explained earlier. Try changing to “Maryland” and see how impactful
                            or not death was due to “Septicemia”
